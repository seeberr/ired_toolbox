# The Implicit Robust Exact Differentiator (IRED) Toolbox

This toolbox provides a Matlab/Simulink(TM) implementation of the
implicit robust exact differentiator (IRED) introduced in [1], which is
an implicit (i.e., backward Euler) discrete-time implementation of the
sliding-mode based robust exact differentiator (RED) [2, 3] that exhibits
neither discretization chattering nor bias errors.
